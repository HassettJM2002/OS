Linux Audting and Logging

Logs for Authentication 
    
  /var/log/auth.log - Authentication related events -> look for ssh, how many times the logon attempts
  /var/run/utmp - Users currently logged in ->
  /var/log/wtmp - History file for utmp
  /var/log/btmp - Failed login attempts

Application
  apache -> web servier directory
  apt -> package manager directory
  /var/log/mysql.log

System
  /var/log/messages -> legacy catch all
  /var/log/syslog -> Ubuntu/Devian Catch all
  dmesg -> Device messanger -> queries /proc/ksmg

Logging at a Glance
    /var/log
    /etc/rsyslog.conf
    /usr/sbin/rsyslogd

Logging Daemon
  /usr/sbin/rsyslogd
    user space damen reads messages written to /dev/log
      kernel ring buffer -> has access to the whole system

COnfig file
  /etc/rsyslog.conf
    log entries follow syslog standard faciility.severity
  facility -> program or part of system
  severity -> urgency

Best Practices for log enumeration and managemment
  Best Practices
  Meaningful naming scheme
  separate logs logiccially and by impoirtanmce
  sync time across network
  control log access

Utilize cron jobs /scripts
  logrote
    /etc/logrotate.comf
    how large the files get and how long do you keep them

Usefull logging commands
  tail -f
  less /var/log/syslog
  logger
  /var/log/messages
  last -f /var/log{wtmp,btmp}

RFC is the standard for whatevr protocol 

Field Guide

/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf -> default logging

less /var/log/syslog
grep timesyncd /var/log/rsyslog
sudo less -f /var/log/syslog

sudo less /tc/logrotate.comf

logs get delted every so often, go to /etc/logrote.conf to find that

systemctl
journalctl -e last log it recieved
journtalctl --list-boots
sudo journalctl -u ssh.service --sense "2 days ago"
json log format, markup language
