4 Linux questions
6 Windows questions

4 hour of notes

Title tells a lot
Look at connections
processes
artifacts
/etc/hosts
persistence

Windows
#######################
Network / Connections
#######################
  Netstat -anob
  Get-Nettcpconnections for Powershell.exe
     Look for ports that are strange
     Look for Meterpreter shell ports
  
Linux
  network
  Netstat -anop / ltup

#####################
Processes

get-process -> parent child relationship, who spawned who, look who spawned who, look for legitimate PIDs
htop / top / atop

start mechanism -> who turned on that process, what turned it on, what started that process, schtasks, user, cronjob

cronjob,schtasks,

persistence
registry
-the run keys are where persistence is usually located
scheduled tasks
-will find 
profiles
-powershell profiles, when startup and when powershell is run, $PSHOME
-linux profiles

net use * http://live.sysinternals.com

artifacts, where to find them, auditing and logging
cyber chef, encoding in rot13 find that one
locations, what info to look for

Linux Notes:
  find if the machine is systemd or sysv
  file /sbin/init, see the symbolic link to the file

systemd
  systemctl list-units
  systemctl list-units --all

  systemctl status <servicename.service>
  systemctl status <PID of service>

  systemctl start/stop/restart <servicename.service>
